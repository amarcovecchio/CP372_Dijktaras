# CP372 Computer Networks Assignment 3 (Fall 2021 term)

Implementation of Dijktara's shortest-path algorithm to generate forwarding-tables for link-state intra-autononmous system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol). Received grade of 102/100 as bonus marks were allocated for implementation of alternative next hop router functionaility (i.e. two or more distinct paths exist with identical cost). This algorithm is used immensely in shortest-path problems spanning fleet optimization, computer networking, and any domain in which the underlying problem can be structured using a graph.
