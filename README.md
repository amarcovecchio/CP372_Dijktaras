# CP372 Computer Networks Assignment 3 (Fall 2021 term)

Code for implementation of Dijktara's least-cost path algorithm to simulate intra-autononmous system router forwarding tables. Received 102/100 as bonus marks were allocated for implementation of alternative next hop router functionaility (i.e. two paths exvist of the same path). This algorithm is widley used to generate forwarding tables in link-state routing proocols: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-state_routing_protocol
